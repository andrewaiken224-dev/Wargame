# Blocker: Unable to implement movement-smoothing fix

I inspected the repository contents and commit history, and this repository currently contains only `.gitkeep` with no game source files.

Because there is no unit spawning or movement code present, I cannot apply the requested fix ("unable to move units smoothly after spawning").

## What I checked

- Working tree files
- Git tree for `HEAD`
- Recent commit history
- Git remotes

## Next step needed

Please provide or restore the project source code/branch so I can implement and validate the movement smoothing fix.
